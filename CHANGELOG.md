# Changelog

## 1.1.0 — 2026-04-03

### Setup: remote and manual modes
- **Remote Immich** (`setup --url http://nas:2283 --api-key KEY`) — queries the Immich API for version, prompts for DB/Redis connection details. Docker on the Mac is optional — if available it pulls the image; if not, it guides you through extracting the server on your NAS and importing with `--import-server`.
- **Manual config** (`setup --manual`) — creates a config template at `~/.immich-accelerator/config.json` for direct editing. Full control, zero auto-discovery.
- **Server import** (`setup --import-server PATH`) — import server files from a directory or tarball extracted on a remote host. No Docker needed on the Mac.

### Web dashboard
- Real-time monitoring at `http://your-mac:8420` with live processing rates and ETAs
- Service health indicators (worker, ML, Docker)
- Re-queue Missing button (triggers all job queues via Immich API)
- Apple Silicon hardware utilization display
- Mobile-friendly layout

### FFmpeg fixes
- **libwebp encoder validation** — setup now checks for `libwebp`, `h264_videotoolbox`, and `hevc_videotoolbox` encoders. Without libwebp, all video thumbnails fail silently.
- **tonemapx → tonemap remap** — Immich's Docker ffmpeg (jellyfin-ffmpeg) has a custom `tonemapx` filter for HDR→SDR. Homebrew ffmpeg doesn't. The wrapper now remaps to upstream `tonemap` + `format` filters for HDR video thumbnails.
- **Two-pass -preset handling** — `-preset` is now correctly stripped for VideoToolbox regardless of argument order.
- **Debug logging** — ffmpeg wrapper logs rewritten commands to `~/.immich-accelerator/logs/ffmpeg-wrapper.log`.

### Fixes
- Sharp rebuilt against system libvips (Homebrew) instead of prebuilt darwin binaries. Handles corrupt HEIF files correctly, matching Docker's behavior.
- Stale process cleanup on `start` — kills orphaned immich/ML processes from previous runs.
- Dashboard uses config values for DB queries instead of hardcoding container/user/db names.
- `cmd_start` always uses config DB password (not stale Docker detection).
- `cmd_watch` uses `extract_immich_server` return value instead of reconstructing path.
- Rate calculations use `time.monotonic()` consistently (immune to NTP/DST clock adjustments).
- API key preserved across `setup` re-runs.
- Submodule pointer fixed (clone --recursive works).

### Documentation
- "Known differences from Docker" section in README — comprehensive table of every deviation from stock Immich.
- Split deployment (NAS + Mac) documentation updated for new setup modes.
- Dashboard section with screenshot.

### Both versions visible
- Dashboard header shows both "Accelerator v1.1.0" and "Immich v2.6.3" badges.
- VERSION file is single source of truth, read by both CLI and dashboard.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-04-01

Major rewrite. The project is now **Immich Accelerator** — runs Immich's own microservices worker natively on macOS instead of custom thumbnail/ffmpeg components.

### What's new
- **Native microservices worker** — Immich's own code extracted from Docker, run bare metal on macOS with full hardware access
- **VideoToolbox video transcoding** — ffmpeg wrapper remaps software encoders to hardware (h264_videotoolbox, hevc_videotoolbox). No Immich patches needed.
- **Accelerator CLI** — `setup`, `start`, `stop`, `status`, `watch`, `update`, `logs`
- **Container extract approach** — server copied from Docker image, always version-matched. Sharp native binary + libvips for HEIF swapped for macOS. No source builds.
- **IMMICH_MEDIA_LOCATION** — Immich's official env var for path mapping. Zero sudo.
- **Auto-update** — detects Immich version changes on start and re-extracts
- **Watchdog** — `watch` command monitors and auto-restarts crashed services
- **Metal concurrency** — shared gpu_lock serializes MLX CLIP (thread-safety bug in MLX), Vision framework runs lock-free on ANE
- **HEIF/HEIC support** — Sharp libvips darwin binary includes full format support

### Hardware utilization (M4 24GB)
| Silicon | Used for | Rate |
|---------|----------|------|
| Metal GPU | CLIP embeddings (MLX) | ~700/min |
| Neural Engine | Face detection + OCR (Vision) | ~200 + 700/min |
| VideoToolbox | Video encode/decode | Hardware-accelerated |
| CPU (NEON SIMD) | Thumbnails (Sharp/libvips) | ~400/min |
| CPU / CoreML | Face embedding (ONNX) | Lock-free, parallel |

### What's removed
- Custom thumbnail worker (replaced by Immich's own Sharp running natively)
- FFmpeg proxy and wrapper scripts (replaced by lightweight ffmpeg wrapper)
- Direct database writes for thumbnails (native worker uses Immich's own job pipeline)

### What's unchanged
- ML service (immich-ml-metal) — native ML via MACHINE_LEARNING_URL

### ML service updates
- Concurrent inference: CLIP, face detection, OCR run simultaneously across GPU/ANE/CPU
- Batched face embeddings: single ONNX call for N faces
- In-memory CLIP: eliminated temp file I/O
- Metal concurrency fix: shared gpu_lock prevents MLX + Vision crashes
- 29 tests

## 0.1.0–0.1.8 — 2026-03-23 to 2026-03-30

Initial release and iterations. Custom thumbnail worker, ffmpeg proxy, ML service. See git history for details.
