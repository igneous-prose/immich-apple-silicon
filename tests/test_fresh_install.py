"""Fresh-install regression tests.

These are the tests that would have caught issues #17 and #18 before
they shipped in 1.4.0. Both bugs only reproduce on a clean Mac — the
maintainer's machine had globally-installed Python packages and a
corePlugin layer that happened to be large enough to survive the
pre-break. A fresh-install reporter caught them within 14 minutes
of each other.

Every test here simulates an environment the maintainer doesn't have.

# Regression: commit f2e4dd2 added a `size_mb < 1` shortcut that broke
# the layer loop BEFORE examining the current layer. Since corePlugin
# lives in a small (~600KB) Docker COPY layer that gets sorted near the
# end of the largest-first order, the break fired right before it was
# extracted. Result: Immich 2.7+ installs missing corePlugin/manifest.json.
