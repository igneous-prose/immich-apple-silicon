# Claude Code Instructions

## Git workflow

- **NEVER push to main without Eric explicitly saying "push" in that message.** Committing locally is fine. Tagging locally is fine. But `git push origin main` requires the word "push" from Eric in the same turn.
- Work on branches. Squash merge to main. One clean commit per release.
- Version bump + CHANGELOG entry required for every push to main.
- Tag releases as `vX.Y.Z` matching the VERSION file.

## Code style

- Python: type hints, f-strings, pathlib for paths.
- Keep it simple. No abstractions for one-time operations.
- The ffmpeg wrapper is bash — keep it minimal, no unnecessary forks.

## Testing

- Deploy to Mac Mini (`ssh macmini`) and verify before claiming anything works.
- Use Playwright for dashboard screenshots.
- Check processing progress via the Immich API, not assumptions.

## Immich compatibility

- Use jellyfin-ffmpeg (same as Docker). Don't patch Homebrew ffmpeg.
- The goal is identical output to Docker Immich wherever possible.
- Document every deviation in the "Known differences" README table.
