# Immich Accelerator

> **Alpha — use at your own risk.** Tested on Mac Mini M4 (24GB) with Immich v2.6.3 and OrbStack. Back up your Immich database before trying this.

Run Immich's compute natively on Apple Silicon. Thumbnails use the fast M-series CPU, video transcoding uses VideoToolbox hardware encoding, and ML runs on Metal GPU, Neural Engine, and CoreML.

Docker handles the lightweight parts (API server, Postgres, Redis). The accelerator runs Immich's own microservices worker natively on macOS, giving it access to hardware that Docker can't reach.

## How it works

```
Docker (lightweight)                 Native macOS (compute)
+-----------------------+           +-------------------------------+
|  immich-server (API)  |           |  Immich Accelerator           |
|  postgres             |<--------->|  +- Microservices worker      |
|  redis                |  DB+Redis |  |  +- Sharp (thumbnails)     |
|                       |           |  |  +- ffmpeg (VideoToolbox)  |
|  WORKERS_INCLUDE=api  |           |  +- ML service                |
|  ML_URL=host:3003     |           |     +- CLIP (MLX/Metal)       |
+-----------------------+           |     +- Faces (Vision/ANE)     |
                                    |     +- OCR (Vision/ANE)       |
                                    +-------------------------------+
```

The microservices worker is extracted directly from your running Immich Docker image. Always the exact same version, no source builds. The only modification is installing the macOS-native Sharp binary for image processing. Video transcoding is intercepted by a lightweight ffmpeg wrapper that remaps software encoders to VideoToolbox hardware encoders.

## What we modify (and how to undo it)

**Nothing inside Docker is modified.** We don't patch Immich, rebuild images, or replace containers. All changes are to your `docker-compose.yml` and can be reverted by removing a few lines.

| What we change | How | Reversible? | Risk |
|---------------|-----|-------------|------|
| Add env vars to docker-compose | `IMMICH_WORKERS_INCLUDE`, `IMMICH_MACHINE_LEARNING_URL`, `IMMICH_MEDIA_LOCATION` | Remove the lines | None |
| Expose Postgres/Redis ports | `5432:5432`, `6379:6379` in docker-compose | Remove the port lines | None |
| Native microservices worker | Extracted from Docker image, runs via `node` | Stop the accelerator | None |
| Native ML service | Separate Python service | Stop the accelerator | None |

**To fully revert:** Stop the accelerator, remove the env vars and port mappings from docker-compose, `docker compose up -d`. Immich is back to stock.

## Requirements

- macOS on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Immich already running in Docker (on this Mac or a remote host like a NAS)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (setup will offer to install Node.js and libvips if missing)
- Python 3.11+ for the ML service

> **FFmpeg:** Downloaded automatically during setup ([jellyfin-ffmpeg](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-ffmpeg) — the same ffmpeg Immich uses in Docker).

## Quick start

### 1. Set up the ML service

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/epheterson/immich-apple-silicon.git
cd immich-apple-silicon/ml
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run setup

**Same-machine (Docker + accelerator on one Mac):**

```bash
cd ..
python -m accelerator setup
```

Auto-detects your Immich instance, extracts the server from Docker, installs the native Sharp binary, and tells you what to change in `docker-compose.yml`.

**NAS + Mac (Docker on NAS, compute on Mac):**

```bash
python -m accelerator setup --url http://nas:2283 --api-key YOUR_KEY
```

Queries the Immich API for version info, prompts for DB/Redis connection details. Generate an API key in Immich (Administration > API Keys). Make sure Postgres and Redis ports are exposed on the NAS (not just localhost). If Docker is on the Mac it pulls the image automatically; if not, it guides you through extracting the server on your NAS.

**Manual config (full control):**

```bash
python -m accelerator setup --manual
```

Creates a config template at `~/.immich-accelerator/config.json`. Edit the connection details, extract the server on your Docker host, and import with `setup --import-server ./server.tar.gz`.

### 3. Configure Docker

The setup command prints the required changes. The key settings:

```yaml
services:
  immich-server:
    environment:
      - IMMICH_WORKERS_INCLUDE=api
      - IMMICH_MACHINE_LEARNING_URL=http://host.internal:3003  # OrbStack
      # Docker Desktop: use http://host.docker.internal:3003 instead
      - IMMICH_MEDIA_LOCATION=/your/upload/path
    volumes:
      # IMPORTANT: use the same absolute path on both sides (not the Docker default)
      - /your/upload/path:/your/upload/path
      - /your/photos:/your/photos:ro
```

Then: `docker compose up -d`

### Understanding path mapping

The native worker and Docker must agree on file paths. Immich stores paths in Postgres — if Docker writes `/usr/src/app/upload/thumb.jpg` but the native worker looks for `/Users/you/immich/upload/thumb.jpg`, things break.

The fix: `IMMICH_MEDIA_LOCATION` tells Immich where files live. Set it to the real host path (like `/Users/you/immich/upload`), and mount that same path in Docker (`-v /Users/you/immich/upload:/Users/you/immich/upload`). Now both sides see the same paths.

**New installs:** Set this from the start. The setup command detects your upload directory and tells you exactly what to use.

**Existing installs:** If you're changing from the Docker default (`/usr/src/app/upload`), Immich automatically rewrites all file paths in the database on the first restart with the new `IMMICH_MEDIA_LOCATION`. This is safe (it's Immich's own migration), but back up your database first.

**External photo libraries:** If you imported photos from an external library (e.g., NAS mount), those paths are stored as-is from when Docker scanned them. If Docker saw them at `/mnt/photos/...`, that's what's in the DB. The native worker needs to see them at the same path. For same-machine setups, mount the library with the same path on both sides (like uploads). For cross-machine setups (NAS + Mac), this requires both machines to see the library at the same path — which may require NFS/SMB mounts that match.

### 4. Start the accelerator

```bash
python -m accelerator start
```

Starts the native microservices worker and ML service. Immich's web UI works as usual. Uploads go through Docker's API, compute happens natively.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `python -m accelerator setup` | Auto-detect local Docker, extract server, configure |
| `python -m accelerator setup --url URL` | Setup from remote Immich instance |
| `python -m accelerator setup --manual` | Create config template for manual editing |
| `python -m accelerator start` | Start native worker + ML |
| `python -m accelerator stop` | Stop native services |
| `python -m accelerator status` | Show what's running |
| `python -m accelerator logs [worker\|ml]` | Tail service logs |
| `python -m accelerator update` | Update to match new Immich version |
| `python -m accelerator watch` | Monitor + auto-restart on crash (for launchd) |
| `python -m accelerator dashboard` | Web UI at http://localhost:8420 |

## Dashboard

Real-time monitoring at `http://your-mac:8420`:

```bash
python -m accelerator dashboard
```

Shows service health, processing progress with live rates and ETAs, Apple Silicon hardware utilization, and system metrics. Mobile-friendly — check from your phone.

## Updates

The accelerator handles Immich updates automatically:

- **On every `start`:** checks the Docker container version, re-extracts if it changed
- **In `watch` mode:** checks every 5 minutes. If Watchtower or a manual `docker compose pull` updates Immich, the watchdog stops the worker, re-extracts the new server, and restarts. No manual intervention needed.
- **Manual:** `python -m accelerator update` if you prefer to control the timing

## Performance tuning

In the Immich admin UI (Administration → Jobs), tune the per-queue concurrency for your hardware. Recommended for M4 with 24GB:

| Queue | Concurrency | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Thumbnail Generation | 4 | CPU-bound (Sharp/libvips with NEON SIMD) |
| Smart Search | 2 | GPU-serialized (MLX Metal, no benefit higher) |
| Face Detection | 3 | Neural Engine (Vision framework) |
| OCR | 3 | Neural Engine (Vision framework) |
| Metadata Extraction | 4 | I/O-bound (exiftool) |
| Video Conversion | 1 | Hardware-accelerated via VideoToolbox |

Higher isn't always better — oversubscribing the CPU causes thrashing and actually reduces throughput.

## Split deployment (NAS + Mac)

For setups where Immich's Docker runs on a NAS and the Mac handles compute:

1. **On the NAS**: Docker runs Immich server (API-only), Postgres, Redis. Expose Postgres and Redis ports (not just localhost).
2. **On the Mac**: The accelerator runs the microservices worker and ML service natively.

```bash
# Setup from the Mac, pointing at the NAS
python -m accelerator setup --url http://nas:2283 --api-key YOUR_KEY

# Or fully manual
python -m accelerator setup --manual
```

Docker is **not required on the Mac**. If Docker isn't installed, setup will guide you through extracting the server on the NAS:

```bash
# Run on your NAS:
docker cp immich_server:/usr/src/app/server - | gzip > immich-server.tar.gz
docker cp immich_server:/build - | gzip > immich-build.tar.gz

# Copy to Mac and import:
python -m accelerator setup --import-server ./immich-server.tar.gz
```

**Path consistency**: The native worker on the Mac needs to see files at the same absolute paths that Docker on the NAS used. Mount the NAS photo directory on the Mac via NFS or SMB. For uploads, `IMMICH_MEDIA_LOCATION` handles this. For external libraries, ensure the Mac's mount path matches what Docker sees.

For example, if Docker on the NAS mounts photos at `/mnt/photos`, the Mac needs an NFS mount at `/mnt/photos` too (or migrate the DB paths — see [issue #2](https://github.com/epheterson/immich-apple-silicon/issues/2)).

## ML service

The ML service is a managed fork of [immich-ml-metal](https://github.com/sebastianfredette/immich-ml-metal) by [@sebastianfredette](https://github.com/sebastianfredette), included as a git submodule. It replaces Immich's Docker ML container with native macOS inference. Upstream changes are reviewed before merging.

| Task | Hardware | Framework |
|------|----------|-----------|
| CLIP embeddings | GPU (Metal) | MLX |
| Face detection | Neural Engine | Apple Vision |
| Face recognition | CPU / CoreML | InsightFace ONNX |
| OCR | Neural Engine | Apple Vision |

Contributions to the ML service are made via [upstream PRs](https://github.com/sebastianfredette/immich-ml-metal/pulls).

## Running as a service

The `watch` command monitors services and auto-restarts on crash. Use it with launchd for unattended operation:

```bash
cp launchd/com.immich.accelerator.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
# Edit the plist: update WorkingDirectory to your repo path
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.immich.accelerator.plist
```

The plist uses `watch` (not `start`) with `KeepAlive` so launchd restarts the monitor if it dies. The monitor in turn restarts ML and the worker if they crash.

## Safety

- **Immich's Docker image is unmodified.** No custom images, no patches.
- **The native worker runs Immich's own code.** Extracted from the Docker image, not reimplemented.
- **UPSERT-safe database writes.** The native worker uses Immich's own job pipeline with the same UPSERT logic.
- **Version-matched.** The extracted server always matches the Docker image version exactly.

## Known differences from Docker

The native worker runs Immich's unmodified code. The ffmpeg and image processing toolchain match Docker. The only differences are in the ML service, which uses Apple-native frameworks instead of ONNX Runtime.

| Area | Docker | Native (Accelerator) | Impact |
|------|--------|---------------------|--------|
| **ffmpeg** | Jellyfin-ffmpeg | Jellyfin-ffmpeg (same binary, macOS arm64 build) | **Identical.** Same `tonemapx` filter, same encoders, same behavior. Downloaded automatically during setup. |
| **ffmpeg encoders** | Software H.264/HEVC | VideoToolbox hardware H.264/HEVC via wrapper | Hardware-encoded output has slightly different bitstream characteristics. Visually equivalent. A lightweight wrapper remaps Immich's software encoder requests to VideoToolbox hardware equivalents. |
| **Sharp / libvips** | Prebuilt linux-arm64 Sharp | Rebuilt against Homebrew system libvips | Identical image output. System libvips handles corrupt HEIF files more gracefully (matches Docker's error handling). |
| **ML: CLIP** | ONNX Runtime | MLX on Metal GPU | Same model, different runtime. Embeddings are numerically close but not identical (floating-point differences). Search results are equivalent. |
| **ML: Face detection** | ONNX Runtime | Apple Vision framework (Neural Engine) | Different model entirely. Detection accuracy is comparable; bounding boxes may differ slightly. |
| **ML: Face recognition** | ONNX Runtime | ONNX Runtime with CoreML | Same model, CoreML acceleration. Numerically close embeddings. |
| **ML: OCR** | PaddleOCR via ONNX | Apple Vision framework (Neural Engine) | Different engine. Vision framework OCR is generally more accurate for Latin text, may differ for CJK. |

### What this means in practice

- **Thumbnails, previews, and video**: Identical to Docker. Same jellyfin-ffmpeg binary, same `tonemapx` HDR tone mapping, same output. VideoToolbox hardware encoding is faster but visually equivalent.
- **CLIP search**: Search results are equivalent but not identical. A search that returns 20 results in Docker will return ~18-20 of the same results natively, possibly in slightly different order.
- **Face grouping**: Faces are detected and grouped correctly. The grouping boundaries may differ slightly (e.g., a borderline face might be grouped differently).
- **OCR**: Text extraction is at least as good as Docker for English/Latin text.

## Security

- Config file (`~/.immich-accelerator/config.json`) is chmod 600
- Postgres exposed on `127.0.0.1:5432` (localhost only) by default
- Redis exposed on `127.0.0.1:6379` (localhost only) by default
- Dashboard binds on `0.0.0.0:8420` (LAN-accessible) — the Re-queue button triggers job processing via the Immich API. If you're on an untrusted network, don't run the dashboard or bind to localhost only

## Migrating from v0.x

If you were using the previous version with the custom thumbnail worker and ffmpeg proxy:

1. Stop old services: `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) com.immich.thumbnail com.immich.ffmpeg-proxy`
2. Remove old plists from `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
3. Remove `IMMICH_WORKERS_EXCLUDE` from your docker-compose (it never worked)
4. Follow the Quick Start above

## On agentic engineering

This project was built iteratively across several sessions with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (Opus 4.6). From zero knowledge of the Immich codebase to a working native accelerator, including upstream contributions to the ML service and a feature discussion with the Immich maintainers. Inspect the code yourself, use it and share it, or don't.
